# Django Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey learning the Django web framework.  I'll be sharing code examples, projects, and notes as I progress through the learning process.  Whether you're a fellow learner or just curious about Django, feel free to explore the contents.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository is organized into different sections, each focusing on specific aspects of Django.  Here's a general overview:

* **`projects/`**: This directory contains individual Django projects I've worked on. 
* **`snippets/`**:  This folder holds smaller code examples and snippets demonstrating specific Django concepts or techniques.  These are often isolated examples to illustrate a particular feature.
* **`notes/`**: This section contains my learning notes, summaries of key concepts, and any challenges I encountered along the way.  These may be in Markdown format or other text files.
